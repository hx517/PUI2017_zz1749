# Citibike Review by uc288 for zz1749

## Null and Alternative hypotheses formulation

The null hypothesis was defined as *"The ratio of man biking at morning (5 am to 12 **am**) over man biking the whole day is the same or higher than the ratio of woman biking at morning over woman biking the whole day"*

Based on this definition, he is suggesting that there are more women who bike in the morning than men. Using ratio to differentiate this is quite good because the bikers are spreadout through the day and getting the ratio will somehow normalize the difference between men and women bikers.

Defining what he means by 'morning' is also a good way to limit the hypothesis and make sure that it is well quantified. Although there seems to be a typo on the highlighted text above which can seem a bit confusing, it is still a very good quantifier.

The math definition of the null and alternative hypothesis are well defined based on the words and they do not overlap which makes it a good hypothesis.


## Data Support
### Variables in data
The following variables are needed from the data:
1. the number of men bikers that bike from 05:00 - 12:00
2. the number of men bikers for the whole day
3. the number of women bikers that bike from 05:00 - 12:00
4. the number of women bikers for the whole day

Numbers 1 and 3 are just a subset of the other 2 variables and these can be easily derived from the CitiBike data. Since the CitiBike data includes the gender and the start date and time of the trip, the data can be grouped by the hour of the day men and women go for a CitiBike ride.


### if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)

## Choose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.

*Optional*
Suggest variations on the question, if you think it may be made more interesting.
