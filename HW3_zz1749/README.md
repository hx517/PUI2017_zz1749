## Here you would find my HW3 for NYU CUSP PUI2017
### In the first two assignments, I followed the instruction of Professor Bianco but I finished everything else by myself. 
### In the second assignment, I discussed with Yukun Wan, Lingyi Zhang, Cheng Ma, Chenrui Zhang on fitting a gaussion distribution of the sample means.

## What I did
### Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem. 

1. Plot Chi-square distribution, Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Binomial distribution, and Gamma distribution.
2. For each sample plot the sample mean against the sample size N and describe the behavior I've seen
3. Fit a gaussian to the distribution of means.

### Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data. 

1. Form a complete hypothesis to be tested and assign a significance level.
2. Use zipfile to unzip the data zipfile from DF and pandas to read the csv file
3. Plot the number of trips of males and females grouped by hour.
4. Add the standard error in the figure.
5. Normalize the distribution of trips.

### Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook.

1. Form a complete hypothesis to be tested and assign a significance level.
2. read the raw data using pandas.read-csv function.
3. Calculate the Z-value.
4. Compare the statistis with the significance threshold and draw a conclusion about the Null Hypothesis.
